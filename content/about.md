We are a small passionate team of Purdue Students committed to making an impact on the way college clubs connect and grow. Our intention is to build experiences that promote and help clubs share information about their organization and increase reach.
As we grow, we hope to provide students with real-world experience working on web development projects while fostering a community and exposing students to new opportunities along the way.
